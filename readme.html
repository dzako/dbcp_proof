<p>This repository contains source files and numerical data of the computer assisted proof of a heteroclinic 
connection in diblock copolymer model (DBCP) as presented in the paper entitled </p>

<p><i>"Computer-assisted proof of heteroclinic connections in the one-dimensional Ohta-Kawasaki model"</i></p>

<p>by Jacek Cyranka and Thomas Wanner</p>

<p>The code uses the code by Jacek Cyranka published in previous works

<code>M</code> is the finite dimensional part of the tail (denoted the same in the paper),</br>

<code>piOverL</code> is the value of $\pi$ divided by the length of the domain $L$.
</p>

<p>The main program source is <code>DBCPModelHetConProof.cpp</code>. The program performs three steps of the proof, as described in 
section 4 Proof of the main result in the paper. See the paper for the details. </br>
The program has to be called exactly in the order specified below.





<h3>First step</h3>
Construction of self-consistent bounds $\mathcal{W}_u\subset H^\prime$, such that $\mathcal{W}_u$ is an unstable isolating block. 
$\mathcal{W}_u$ is centered at the origin, and is verified to satisfy the cone condition. After compilation the first step of
the proof is performed by the program by calling the program with the argument as follows
<pre><code>./DBCPModelHetConProof manifold
</code></pre>
<p>The program prints out to the standart output the constructed self-consistent bounds $\mathcal{W}_u$ using the format
<pre><code>mode_index: interval_bounds</pre></code>
It also outputs the values used to verify cone condition (e.g. the value denoted in the paper $\varepsilon$, which is required to be positive).
</p>
<p>The program outputs the numerical data with one of the faces of $\mathcal{W}_u$ (denoted in the paper by $W_0$) to the file
<pre><code>manifold.in</pre></code>
This file is going to be the input to the next steps of the proof (the following program calls as described).</p>
<p>The file <code>unstable_box_log.txt</code> generated by the program contains some output from the algorithm computing the 
unstable isolating block $\mathcal{W}_u$. And output from the verification of the cone conditions (e.g. cone conditions vector
with values).</p>





<h3> Second step</h3>
<p>Construction of self-consistent bounds $\mathcal{W}_s\subset H^\prime$, such that $\mathcal{W}_s$ is a stable isolating block. 
$\mathcal{W}_s$ is centered at a numerically computed approximation to the actual stable equilibrium $z^s_0$. This step requires
different configuration (Galerkin approximation dimension must be larger) it is contained in the file 
<code>fixedpoint_config.in</code>.</p>
<p>Also there is another input file needed. 
File <code>fixedPoint.in</code> contains the approximate stable fixed point, which is used to find appropriate coordinates for
the algorithm building the stable isolating block $\mathcal{W}_s$.</p>
<pre><code>m=39
M=250
dftPts=80
dftPts2=400
order=7
step=0.0001
lambda=4
sigma=0.405285
piOverL=0.5
</code></pre>
<p>The file <code>stable_box_log.txt</code> generated by the program contains some output from the algorithm computing the 
stable isolating block $\mathcal{W}_s$.</p>

<p>The program outputs to the standart output the constructed self-consistent bounds $\mathcal{W}_s$ using the format</p>
<pre><code>mode_index: interval_bounds</pre></code>

<p>The finite part of the bounds $\mathcal{W}_s$ are computed in the  eigenbasis, the used coordinates are being saved into the files 
<code>Q.in</code> and <code>Qinv.in</code> (used in the following step).
The finite dimensionl part of the bounds is saved into the files <code>x0.in</code> and <code>r.in</code> (decomposed into
middle point and radiuses and used in the following step).</p>

<p>The numerical data of the self-consistent bounds $\mathcal{W}_s$ are saved into the file (used in the following step)
<pre><code>basin.in</pre></code></p>








<h3> Third step</h3>
The final step of the algorithm.</br>
Numerically integrate forward in time the bounds containing a part of unstable manifold (denoted  $W_0$ in the paper)  
 until it is trapped in the interior of $\mathcal{W}_s$.
</p>
<p>
The program reads the input bounds for $W_0$ and $\mathcal{W}_s$ computed in the previous steps from the files <code>manifold.in</code>,
<code>basin.in</code> and the detailed data about a finite dimensional part of $\mathcal{W}_s$ saved in <code>Q.in</code>, 
<code>Qinv.in</code>, <code>x0.in</code> and <code>r.in</code>.
</p>
	
<p>The program outpus to the standard output the polynomial bounds read from the input files <code>manifold.in</code>,
and <code>basin.in</code>. Then it outputs status of the integration process, when the entry of the time propagated $W_0$
into $W_s$ is achieved (the third step was completed)  it outputs the time when the goal was achieved, and the final bounds.</p>
<p>Detailed numerical data can be found in the logfile <code>integration_log.txt</code> generated by the program, 
to which at each timestep it saves
<ul>
<li>the vector being finite dimensional part of the propagated bounds,</li>
<li><i>each $100$ steps of the integration</i> the full infinite dimensional polynomial bounds.</li>
<li>at which coordinates the entry of $W_0$ into $\mathcal{W}_s$ is NOT yet attained.</li>
</ul>
